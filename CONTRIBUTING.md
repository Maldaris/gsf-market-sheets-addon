# Contribution Guide

## Requirements

Must have an EVE character within the Imperium. Verify your github account by sending a EVE Mail to Byron DuMont with a link to your pull request.

## Code Conventions

As long as your changes do not contain warnings using the default JSHint configuration for ES5 Javascript, your code will likely be accepted. It's recommended that you provide at least one test for your function to easily verify its behavior, as well as documentation updates.
